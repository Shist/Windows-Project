# Windows-Project

### Project on native Javascript which is about site of a company that works with windows and which provides its services to clients.

---

### This project is hosted using the Vecel.com platform, you can see how it works here:
## https://shist-windows-project.vercel.app/

### Attention! Since this site is based on back-server, the POST methods (which are using inside modal windows with forms) are not sending data anywhere. So it is normal to face mistakes in console.
